    This XML file is a EPICS V4 IOC Database definition file, which defines 
	the interface for the EPICS v4 service named cfService. 
	
	The arguments to cfService, are a "query" String, and a 
	String containing the parameters. The query is simply a text string in the
        format of a ChannelFinder query. 
		
	Presently, the "parameters" argument is not used by cfService. It 
	might be used in a future version.
