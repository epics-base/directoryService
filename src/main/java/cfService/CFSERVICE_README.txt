RDBSERVICE_README.txt

This is the README file of the rdbService module. rdbService is a minimal EPICS V4
service which demonstrates the use of EPICS V4 RPC support in pvService for
implementing a relational database service, and client that shows how users can
trivially get data from a db like Oracle.

EXAMPLE
-------
The following is an example of running the client. This examples gets details about
all the devices in the SwissFEL Test accelerator from the PSI Oracle database, and
prints them to the terminal. For brevity, only 6 rows of the output are included
here:

  % ./rdbClientRunner swissfeltest:alldevices

SUMMARY
-------
rdbService is a minimum client and server implemented in the EPICS v4 RPC "framework"
intended to show programming required to implement a service that gets data out of a
relational database, like Oracle. The server side receives a named request for data,
such as "swissFEL:allQUADs" and finds the SQL SELECT (or equivalent) database query
for that name. It then executes the database query, and returns the resulting table
of data to the client.
	RdbService illustrates mapping a JDBC ResultSet returned by a relational DB
query, to a PVStructure (in fact, specifically an early version of the NTTable
normative type), extracting the data from a PVStructure (see use of GetHelper class)
and a tabular data formatting utility useful for printing the tabular contents of an
NTTable (see use of NamedValues class).

REQUISITES
----------
EPICS V4 components. Basically, check these repos out of EPICS V4 Mercurial
1. common  - for source/pvCommon_setup.bash
2. pvAccessJava - for PVAccess 
3. pvDataJava   - for PVData 
4. pvIOCJava    - for JavaIOC 
5. pvService    - for service xml
6. exampleJava   - for the rdbService java classes and config files.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
0. Most importantly, work out how your rdbService server side will translate the
   names it is given, like "myaccelerators:magnetdata" into a SQL SELECT
   statement. As shipped rdbService does this in RdbServiceFactory, by looking up the
   name it was given in a trivial 2-column Oracle table called EIDA_NAMES (see
   RdbServiceFactory.java). Eg:

   sls:alldevices	         Select * from sls.alldevices_v
   sls:allmagnets	         Select * from sls.magnetdevice_v order by domain,ds
   sls:allmagnetdata	         Select * from sls.magnetddata_v order by type
   swissfeltest:sectiontree	 Select *  from swissfel.swissfel_test_tree_v

   Then edit your version of rdbServiceRunner to pass the right Java Properties (-Ds) 
   for such things as the jdbc connection URL, schema name etc.

   Work out how to get a password to your server. In the shipped example the 
   password is in rdbServiceRunner but you'll want a better way for production.
   
1. Edit your version of common/script/pvCommon_setup.bash, and set the value of JAVAIOC

2. Edit your version of exampleJava/src/rdbService/rdb_setup.bash and set it for your
   environment


 
EXECUTION
---------
This section describes how you start server and client sides of the rdb Service. 
Start the server side first.

To start the rdbService server 
------------------------------
1. cd to the directory containing the rdbService source files:

   E.g. % cd ~/Development/epicsV4/ev4hg/exampleJava/src/rdbService
  
2. If you have never started the server before (for instance you are deploying 
   a fresh install), then you'll need to edit rdb_setup.bash to change values of 
   WORKSPACE and RDBXML (possibly others).


3. Start the server in one terminal 

   E.g. % ./rdbServerRunner
   
   Verify that the line beginning "installed records.." shows records from
   rdbService.xml, and it looks successful. You should see, at the end of the startup
   echos, "Running server ..."
  
4. Terminate the server with a SIGTERM (like CTRL-C in its process window) - after
   you've tested it with the client below of course.
   
   
To run the rdbService example client
--------------------------------------------
In another window from the server:
 
1. cd to the directory containing the rdbService files (both client and server are in
   the same dir for demo purposes)
   
   E.g. % cd ~/Development/epicsV4/ev4hg/exampleJava/src/rdbService
 
2. Execute the client side example runner script rdbClientRunner, giving as an
   argument the name of some query you know is understood by the server. In this
   example "LCLS:elementInfo.byZ" is theis "key" understood by the rdbService to
   lookup the SQL SELECT string which is itself the SQL query the service executes to
   get the data.
 
   E.g. % ./rdbClientRunner  swissfeltest:alldiag
   
   Alternatively, use the getRdb wrapper of the client side executable:
   
   E.g. % getRdb swissfeltest:alldiag
   

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
======================

At PSI there is an Oracle database for SLS and anther for SWissFEL projects. A single
oracle "schema" named EIDA has been granted read access to both of these. The example
rdbService uses that schema to access data in the other 2 schema.

The name to SQL query mapping is stored, in this example, within the EIDA schema
itself (though other implementations may like to keep the mapping elsewhere, such as
in a directory service).  Specifically, EIDA_NAMES is a table in EIDA, which just has
2 important columns, the "names" of queries (what a user asks for), and the SQL
statement equivalent to that query (the SQL that the rdb Server executes when the
user asks for a given name. Here is an extract from EIDA_NAMES:

NAME                        QRY
------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------------
sls:alldevices	            Select * from sls.alldevices_v
sls:allmagnets	            Select * from sls.magnetdevice_v order by domain,ds
sls:allmagnetdata	        Select * from sls.magnetddata_v order by type
swissfeltest:sectiontree	Select * from swissfel.swissfel_test_tree_v
swissfeltest:alldevices	    Select * from swissfel.feltest_heilig_v order by PREFIX,"Z0(M)"
<many rows snipped for clarity>

So, when a user asks for, for example, swissfeltest:alldevices, the rdbService first
looks in EIDA_NAMES to find the QRY whose NAME is swissfeltest:alldevices, and then
it executes the SQL statement it finds 'Select * from swissfel.feltest_heilig_v order
by PREFIX,"Z0(M)". Simple as that.

Eg:
[gregsmac:exampleJava/src/rdbService] greg% ./rdbClientRunner swissfeltest:alldevices | more

PERFORMANCE
-----------

No serious performance measurements have been done. Note that the server side has
been written for illustrative clarity as an EPICS V4 example, not for
performance. But for example, see the mid-sized sample below: *including* client
image startup (ie starting a java vm and executing the client), this SwissFel ORACLE
db query took about 3/4s user time, to request, execute the SQL, get ResultSet from
oracle, return it to the client as a PVStructure, and client side to format, about
560 rows of data.

* Small size sample: 2610 characters, 18 rows, takes 1/2 second. Probably mostly image startup.
[gregsmac:exampleJava/src/rdbService] greg% time ./rdbClientRunner swissfeltest:sectiontree > /dev/null
0.541u 0.104s 0:02.20 29.0%     0+0k 9+2io 373pf+0w
[gregsmac:exampleJava/src/rdbService] greg% time ./rdbClientRunner swissfeltest:sectiontree | wc
      18     188    2610
* Mid size sample: ~600 rows in 3/4 second.
[gregsmac:exampleJava/src/rdbService] greg% time ./rdbClientRunner swissfeltest:alldevices > /dev/null
0.774u 0.076s 0:00.61 137.7%    0+0k 0+0io 8pf+0w
[gregsmac:exampleJava/src/rdbService] greg% ./rdbClientRunner swissfeltest:alldevices | wc
     567    9556  120204
* Large size sample: 60M characters (all the pvname data) in SLS, took 13 seconds:
[gregsmac:exampleJava/src/rdbService] greg% time ./rdbClientRunner sls:allpvnames >/dev/null
13.270u 2.201s 0:38.66 40.0%    0+0k 21+72io 8pf+0w
[gregsmac:exampleJava/src/rdbService] greg% ./rdbClientRunner sls:allpvnames | wc
  348848 3136676 60350704

So, extremely roughly speaking, a rdbClient user sees ~1/2 Megabyte query result data
per second, based on simple unoptimized Oracle queries executed by unoptimized JDBC,
and, importantly, including the reformatting for printing that a real application would
probably skip or do itself. So, it's not slow!
